# Talented DevOps Challenge

## The situation

A customer is eager to migrate its workload from a traditional approach to a __Cloud Native__ one embracing the DevOps methodology at its best.

This customer is offering a Software as a Service made of a set of web applications and databases (e.g.: __CRM__) and would like to enforce the network segregation between customers.

Furthermore, it would like to automate the onboarding of new end-users without the need of dealing with APIs and having a single source of truth.

### Kubernetes Managed

The customer would like to use Kubernetes in a managed way: there is no constraint on the infrastructure provider, the single prerequisite is an installation using the IaC (infrastructure as code) approach.

### Application

As code challenge, we're not providing an example code base but this can be easily any application, as [podinfo](https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo) or any blog as Ghost, or WordPress.

### Document it

The customer is expecting documentation on how to manage the whole infrastructure as well as installing it: you have to document all the needed steps.

## Delivery

Just raise your PR against this repository, documenting all the changes.

We evaluate all best practices regarding contributions (e.g. commit subjects and body): it's an exclusive asynchronous task, we should be able to evaluate all your skills without dealing with you directly.
